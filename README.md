A visual vocabulary game where users can interact and truly test their knowledge of a word! It's as simple as adding a drawing to the word on the screen similar to the concept of a flashcard word/definition. The "Quiz Mode" feature is where another user(s) must accurately guess the word to the drawing that pops up on the screen within a given time limit. This fun competition allows for users to master the definition of a word through visuals rather than plain words on a flashcard!
